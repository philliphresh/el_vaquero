Go now. (and order the cheese dip...you won't be disappointed.)"

I am a fan of this location; even when busy I never have to wait long for a seat. The service is always excellent and the patio is great in the summer and winter. The bar area is a bit cramped so if you elect to eat at the bar you will most likely bump into waiters/waitresses and people in the surrounding booths.Salsa is always perfect, refills are plenty and good eats are always had."

It's cheap, bland and dry2) ""Shredded Chicken"" (with one exception detailed below) It's uninspired and bland.There are a few real gems on the El Vaq menu, so let me first start with my exception to the shredded hicken item: the Ckicken Tamale !!!The tamale is well done, seasoned masa steamed perfecty and then covered with that bland shredded chicken. HOWEVER!, the enchilada sauce that El Vaq smothers the tamale (and enchiladas) with is pure heaven! It has a noticable sweet-cinnamon tinge but with a deep and rich savory complexion. It really ties the nasa and chicken together and makes for the best tamale I've had in C-Bus.Also: A great value is found in the #158: El Mariscos. Shrimp and scallops perfectly sauteed and served on cheesy rice with a semi-spicy brown sauce. #143 (El Sinaloense) finds chicken strips (not the shredded chicken) well-seasoned w/cumin/coriander/chile powder atop a bed of deliciously greasy/spicy chorizo. Farmers cheese is melted over the lot and served w/tortillas for rolling your own.Try these 3 items, stay away from the abovementioned ingredients and I think you'll find El Vaq to be a great Mexican Experience!"

I'm definitely a fan, but I have to be craving a tamale or tacos to really appreciate eating here. The menu is rather pedestrian, with every combination of above-average Americanized mexican food. You got your tamales and fajitas and carnitas ... and also, Margaritas!I'm not big into tequila drinks, but many, many of my friends come here specifically for the Margaritas. Food is just a side though. I quite like them too, but the Mexican beer selections i quite good too!  The wine--- not so much...As for the service, Speedy Gonzales has nothing on these guys!

I'd been told it was the best Mexican in Columbus - I don't know if I'd go that far, but it was pretty good.Went with a couple friends on a Friday night and there were a ton of people waiting - even though it was kind of a late dinner. I had the yucatan style chicken which was good. One of my friends had a spinach quesadilla and the other had something pretty standard... a burrito maybe? Anyway, they both really liked their meals. The prices were reasonable and portions were pretty big.They have an awesome patio - which is always a plus. It's pretty big and has nice big comfy chairs =)"

Having never been to Texas, I don't know what that means. I guess the food should have been served in a ten gallon hat. Anyway, I ordered a chicken fajita, which was good (not spectacular, but nice), and so was the complimentary chips and accompanying order of guacamole (though mine had a bit too much garlic in it). The atmosphere was friendly enough and my margarita went down smooth. I liked it. It's probably one of the best Mexican/Tex-Mex options in C-Bus."

Being from California, I'd go again and here's what I'd order: carnitas - very authentic and tasty. I ordered a taco and forgot that it would be a hard shell (argh!), expecting a nice soft tortilla with minimal trimmings (i.e. NO cheese!). I'd avoid the chicken next time (in creamy like sauce, not sure what that's about). The salsa was excellent and you can order pico de gallo. Also, the staff all speak Spanish and I was able to order better for my kids in the native tongue."

Great food my favorites #143, #50 and the chicken tamale.One busy Saturday while waiting we went to the bar and met Lorena who made us the best margaritas I've ever had.

The food is probably the best Mexican you'll find in Ohio!

If you've ever been to Tijuana or the border towns in California you know that the best Mexican food comes from the dirtiest dives. El Vaquero isn't as tidy as I usually like for a restaurant... but oh man, the food makes up for it. Germs die when heated up, right?!"

I was seated quickly and was promptly asked for my drink order, while being brought some warm chips, and salsa.  My drinks came out quickly and I browsed the menu with relative amusement as to how many  different options there really were to eat at this place. In my mind its always a bad sign for the menu to be multiple pages, but I decided on my entree. The salsa was good, there seems to be this trend at all the Mexican restaurants  in Columbus that I go to that makes the salsa watery, El Vaquero followed on the same path, but there was still a good kick and I Was pleasantly surprised. Food came out very quickly, my order of a chimichanga, which came with rice and beans, and guacamole salad was a good size for the price ( just under 7 dollars)Everything about my meal was satisfyingly, it was hot, and pretty tasty, but the chicken filling in my chimi was cold, and had a strange taste to it. I noticed that in the back of the menu they describe the chicken as being pre-cooked. It was indeed, dried out, and cold. IF they left it on the stove in a nice sauce, then it would have been much more enjoyable. Still the food was above average, and I have certainly had worse. I'll be back though, they seem to have a good happy hour, a decent sized patio for when it gets below 100 degrees and friendly attentive service."

Their food doesn't taste authentic to me.The service here is good with friendly staff and relatively quick service. Being able to sit outside on the patio is always nice if the weather is amiable. Unfortunately for me, the food is not great or good. Instead I would have to say that it's merely ""OK.""One discrepancy that strikes me as pretty big on the occasions when I have dined here is that the chips are pretty thick.

El Vaquero is pretty close to home so off I went in search of chips n salsa and a great patio to enjoy the weather.While the salsa was average, and the patio ended up being an enclosed patio with floor-to-ceiling windows that open wide to create an open patio-like space - which actually was really cool - the food ending up being OK and service was quite slow.The menu has nearly 100 items ranging from semi-authentic to totally americanized. Sifting through and narrowing down the options takes a bit, but the sheer number of combinations is impressive nonetheless.Everything is fancified in the building.

Perhaps you thought i wouldn't notice, because it was supposed to be covered up by that tortilla wrap! but alas, homegirl tries to minimize her flour intake (yea i know, then what am i doing at a mexican joint?! .....) so i discovered the yucky quality meat when i unwrapped the tortilla. boo =(one thing that i liked/was disturbed by (a strange combination of emotions btw) was how extremely fast our food came out after we ordered. I think it was literally 3 minutes....it seemed to barely cover the time it would have taken for our waiter to walk over to the kitchen, place our order, and then walk back. wtf?! fast is good, but too fast?? at a sit-down restaurant?? with a crazy long menu?!? makes one wonder...it also makes one think that you should consolidate your menu bc you're obviously not doing that many different tricks in the kitchen.though El Vaquero may seem like a good deal because it's pretty cheap ($8-$20 range) for a ***ginormous*** plate of food, you're actually losing out because: A. the food is bad quality  B. the food sucks and C. nobody should be eating that much unhealthy food.My advice: go to chipotle or taco bell, where at least you get what you pay for.hey E.V., how bout you serve smaller portions, but better quality food!? doesn't that make more sense? other weird stuff: the bartender is sunken into the ground, which creates a strange effect....at first i thought he was a small person. the bathroom is unexpectedly nice - however, the 3 unlabeled containers in the middle of the counter are NOT filled with 3 different kinds of handsoap! that'll be to your left, which i discovered after a few rounds of trial and error...."

I've been to a few locations and they are definitely consistent with food and experience. Also, great job on the renovations to this location (although I do wish the patio felt a little more patio-like).Service is remarkably fast. Like, I think our food arrived 5 minutes after placing the order. I appreciate this, but most of the time I want to relax and enjoy a meal so it was a little too speedy for me. Almost felt like they just wanted to turn the table (which I'm sure is what happens on busier Friday and Saturday nights). The food is good and portions are huge, but El Vaq seems to have their prices hovering a few bucks above what I see at other similar restaurants. I can get basically the same meal down the road at Rancho Allegre for quite a bit less - and their margaritas are stronger (also cheaper).I'll probably keep toggling between this place and other Mexican restaurants in the area- bf loves his Mexican feasts.

Honestly, I REALLY wanna give this establishment 5 stars! And overall, I really wanna give this company as a whole 5 stars. But because of my reasons, I just can't. So here are my reasons for 3, not 5.Hang in with me. This is a long one! LOL* For this location specifically, my husband and I frequently come here. And while we appreciate the rejuvenation that has occurred here (such as their nice temperature controlled patio, the updated decor, etc), the service is sometimes subpar, UNLESS you are sitting at the inside bar. When you're seated at a table or booth, you quickly can become overwhelmed at attempting to guess WHO is actually YOUR server. * This brings me to service actually. Because of the multiple people that will come by your table/booth at any given time during your dining experience, this makes for a communication FAIL. As well, out of the 5 different servers that check on you, what happens when one ticks you off and that one just so happens to be the last one to visit your table? Personally, I want my FULL TIP to go to the servers I had a decent exchange with vs the one that ticked me off. But how do I know? Fact is, I don't.* Also, by way of servers- on more than one occasion, because of the lack of communication between the small village that takes care of the same table, getting something as minor as a refill for your soft drink, turns into an insulting experience. I have witnessed more than once, multiple staff members going by tables where people are heavier in weight, and picking up their soft drink and asking MORE THAN ONCE , ""Diet?"", when they know it's not. Then the same server will go to the soft drink dispenser, speak in Spanish and look at the overweight patron and literally laugh at them.Sorry, but overweight people come from all walks of life and nationalities. And if I'm being judge-y- some of them are even the ""weight staff"" right there at this establishment. And to add insult to injury, those overweight servers at this establishment are clearly in denial of their bulge, because their shirts look like they should fit a 3 year old, thus making them appear to be a can of busted biscuits.But I digress. All I'm saying, is to the staff at this location: You're not slick or funny when you attempt to get a dig in at someone overweight by your obnoxious question of whether or not their drink is ""diet"". Just remember, that overweight person contributes to your paycheck.* The last time we were in this location, we had a full bottle of salsa left over from our dinner. So naturally, I wanted a container to pour it into to take home with the rest of our leftovers. I was shocked to see the Mexican guy tell our American bartender to CHARGE US $5.00 for the salsa that should have/would have been thrown away anyway. It became SUCH an ordeal, that we were actually forced to do a SECOND transaction for the salsa. Sure, I could have left it. But my husband being the nicer of the two of us, just went ahead and paid it to avoid conflict. I understand the difference between ordering specifically some salsa to go and pouring your leftover salsa from your table into a container too.Lastly, let's talk about LOCATION CONSISTENCY.I get the #54 every time I go. Literally, like its my job. My order NEVER CHANGES. However, this much I can guarantee- the #54 at this location is the best. But when I go to any other location, it's nowhere near the same. It's so off from the ""original"", that it feels like I've ordered a completely different dish. Train the staff better, so that I can go to any location, order the #54, and KNOW for certain that I will be getting exactly what I know I've ordered. I only say that to this location, because this location has admitted that everyone at the other locations, were trained at this location first.Stay consistent, tell your staff to be nicer to those customers they may see as being overweight, let ONE server work with one table at a time and don't try to charge people for their leftovers and I will continue to stay a loyal customer and even come back and adjust my stars!!"

There was a little confusion with a couple of the orders (20 people after all, including 5 under 7 yrs) but the issues were remedied quickly and politely. I had 2 chimichangas (1 beef and 1 chicken) with refried beans and Mexican rice. Very good. Next time I will get both beef though. So tender. Chicken could have used a little bit of seasoning.

I like to visit El Vaq each time I'm back home, but the past few experiences have not been great. Both times I have been there with my family, we ordered cheese dip with our drink orders. Both times the waiters forgot to bring our cheese dip until we reminded them when ordering our meals. The last visit, my sister ordered a pitcher of the Patron Margaritas. When they came out, we could barely even taste the extra Patron in them. When we mentioned this to the waiter, he was kind enough to bring a 'shot' of Patron to add to the pitcher. At least this addition brought out a little of the tequila flavor and not just the sour mix flavor. I ordered the tacos and they were delicious!! I think they were the Tacos de Pollo Marinado. They had chicken, cilantro and feta cheese on a corn tortilla, with a side of black beans. Highly suggest these new tacos that are offered on the menu. They are definitely a step up from the chicken fajitas I used to order! I'm hoping I've just visited El Vaq on their ""off nights"" or new wait staff. I will definitely keep coming back when I'm in town, just because it's tradition to get El Vaq with my family.

We hadn't made any other purchases that day When I called the restaurant to inform them that their restaurant might not be secure, the assistant manager refused to take any action and was extremely rude to me.

Quest dip is great.  If you are in a hurry and need a quick place to eat.. el vaq is the place.  More restaurants need to care as much as they do.  No one that works here is a slacker.  Watch how fast they bus the tables and clean them.  It is like The Indianapolis 500 pit crew of table cleaners.  Patio is great as the doors can open when it is nice out or be closed with AC or heat.  Always busy!!  If you have to wait it is under 10 minutes always.  We have been here when mariachi bands are here on special celebrations.  Cinco de mayo is always a blast here.  It is great any day and that is why we are family regulars and we always bring guests here with us.   Great place, great people, great atmosphere.  Don't let the internet trolls sway you away.  I personally have eaten here for the full 25 years before I knew my husband.

Everyone that goes to El Vaquero knows it's mediocre food and the service depends on the location. On the weekends we go because it's one of few restaurants that has a 4-8 happy hour even on Saturday and Sunday. As usual the service and food was...fine. You get what you pay for and that's the reason for this review. I will actually not be returning to this El Vaq based on the level of BS I just experienced. First. Standard mediocre service and food. Fine, no problem. Actually, it's kid coronavirus scare and I'm tipping extra these days bc I'm not sick and I feel for local companies. I'm there with my sister. Her husband just lost his job amidst this and I bought them dinner the other night elsewhere. Because El Vaq insists on still not giving separate checks even though we asked for them my sister checks out separately bc she has to get home to her baby. She pays for my full meal except a cheese dip. Naturally I'm not happy she did that because she should not be spending money. When I get to the register to pay for one cheese dip that charge me for my margaritas. That's my sister paid for. I call her on speaker, she had to leave to be with said baby, she repeats what she paid for. The woman/young lady taking money is the same person. She's rude about it. Insists she did not ask for that. He bill was well over $50. Do I mind paying for my food?! He'll no! The whole reason I'm here is to simulate the economy. Am I posed I'm being double charged especially when my sister who can't afford it already paid for it and I'm being treated rudely? Uh yeah Kim Jong Un... way to take advantage of your loyal customers. I asked for a receipt. Of course they say things like liquor 1 and food 2. Cool, this is absolutely useless.

Well there is no way my bill would have been $53 just for me and my 10 month old that got a mini quesadilla. Not possible. So now my sister has also paid for her drinks that I already paid for. Do we mind paying if they hadn't been paid for, NO!  But I do mind that they were extremely rude and over charged us, YES! These are tough times for our economy now that we are social distancing and I thought going out tonight would help this business bring in some money. I will never be helping this location bring in money again and I suggest that you don't either because they are RUDE and DISHONEST!"

My girlfriends quesadilla came with 2 sides and she tried the brown & yellow rice which were both very good as well.

I do not mind Mexican cuisine sometimes, so off we went.El Vaquero like so many Mexican restaurants has an adobe look on the outside and colorful tiles on the inside of the restaurant. I personally like the uplifting feeling you get with vibrant colors. Employees were all wearing PPE attire.As far as the food is concerned, it seemed authentic, in that, I experienced a similar style of preparation when visiting Mexico but I am far from an authority on Mexican cuisine. They were playing Mexican music which I can listen to once in awhile. You have a choice of either patio or indoor dining. The menu is extensive and can be scan from a table bar code. Complimentary chips and salsa are set on the table before you order but I must say according to my taste, I have had better.  I eventually ordered a Tilapia dish and she had a burrito. Each was about $10 and inline with other Mexican restaurants, I have been to. The portion size was large.  Both of us enjoyed our meals and I have to say that the watermelon Margaritas during the discounted Happy Hour sure did help.

I can't commend them enough on how much food they give you, and the menu selections are seemingly endless, but certain elements to their food are uniformly cheap and make me wish that I was back at the ill-fated franchises of my youth. My main gripe with El Vaquero is the cheese they use on everything. There's no doubt in my mind that it's either squeezed out of a tube or made by adding water to something. More times than not, it's absolutely terrible. I've had drunken experiments with Velveeta and a leftover Taco Bell soft taco that turned out far better. Granted, I'm an absolute cheesehead that's perennially spoiled every Christmas by an aunt and uncle from Milwaukee, but this is absolutely the lowest grade of process cheese known to man. Two thumbs down. Also, the house salsa that comes with the chips you get before your entrees come out is runny and has no substance to it whatsoever. Again, I thank Chili's for spoiling me with their amazing yet mass-produced salsa that I've been hooked on since I turned 12. With those gripes out of the way, the El Vaquero franchise is pretty decent in every other respect. The margaritas are stiff as a board, the food comes out lightning fast, and the atmosphere there is awesome. Some people have taken issue with how busy it can get, but it's very rare that you'll be waiting more than ten minutes for a table, if at all. If you avoid something that's doused in luke warm cheese food, you're sure to be impressed and will be back again soon."

Before the meal even came out they brought a fresh cilantro filled salsa with warm corn chips. I asked for a hot salsa and there were 2 that came. One was a habanero lime mix and the other a smoky Chipolte. Both were amazing and hot too.The meals came quickly and were fresh and tasty. The fajitas for 2 could have easily fed 3.

A few minutes later, our drink orders were taken and in less than a minute, we had a big cup of liquidity goodness.Before long... yep, you guessed it. Our two Fajita Express lunch ($9 - $11) specials were taken, and I swear in less than three minutes, our food was already out. We had also ordered a side of guac and sour cream, both of which came in cute tortilla bowls which I'm sure are edible if you chose to snack on it.My steak fajita was not bad! It was definitely better when piping hot, but I remember having one or two really juicy pieces. The blend of seared veggies on the skillet complimented the meat, but again, are best eaten when hot. Once it cools down a bit, it does get a bit chewy which is disappointing, but overall still good.We had a great time here and I'm so glad I got to eat here.

Sure you can have your tacos, your burritos, your guacamole; I will enjoy my Italian, German, Greek, oriental fare. But there is one ironic catch: the chicken fajita is in my top five favorite dishes over all the food in the world. My opinion, Al Vaquero serves up one of the best chicken fajita in town-- in the American interpretation of Mexican that is.Coming out steaming on a plate, the chicken strips excites the stomach.  Next to it fresh peppers, beans, rice, onion shrooms--the usual--allowing you ( I know this is done everywhere) to pick the make-up of your meal; rolling the chosen ingredients in the hot tortilla shell is a ritual of excited anticipation.Add to it a cold bottle of Dos Equis and you really have a satisfying meal. Or choose Corona, and really put the IN in inauthentic.The decor is stereotypical southwestern with its adobe like stucco and brink arches, but it is beautiful all the same. The place has a great atmosphere. It works as a place old friends can gather before hitting the town, an intimate date spot, or a casual dinner place to take work friends and clients when deciding to move up a step from Panera/ Chipotle level.  The service here is great, fast. The food comes in large sizes so you may leave with a doggie bag instead of hunger. Although I will never try anything else, various dinner mates say that their other servings are good.

And, for the second time in a row, midway through my ""vegetarian"" chimi, there was a hunk of meat. When I told the waitress, she said NOTHING, took my plate, and then left, and never came back. Finally one of us went to get her because we needed checks (at this point, it was so bad that only one person had anything to drink, which was a half glass of water, and the rest of us took turns pouring drinks of water from her glass into ours). When the waitress returned, she handed us the checks. We asked to see the manager. After a long wait, another staff person came over and said that the manager was ""too busy"" to see us - he was busy with the health inspector. I told him about the meat in my vegetarian meal, and he said that he was sorry, but it was difficult to keep meat out of the vegetarian food because of the way the kitchen is set up.I am disgusted and angry. For the second time in a row, I have become sick from eating at this restaurant."

They asked my name and said 10-15 min, but were promptly agreeable to having the meal ready at the later time. They confirmed their location before hanging up. My wife swung by on her way back from work around 5:30 and was not immediately acknowledged by the hostesses when she entered, but instead waited patiently for them to finish their conversation. Luckily, I had picked up the kids earlier because they claimed that there were no orders in for pick up either by phone or online and sent her back out to the car to ask me if I called in the order to the correct location. We spoke on the phone and I hung up then called the restaurant back to ensure that the order went to the right location. In the meantime, they asked my wife what meal #s we ordered and she wasn't sure. I don't know why they bothered to take my last name but not use that to find the order. They found the order eventually, and said it would be right out and offered her a glass of water while she waited. They explained that they didn't find the order initially because it wasn't placed in the last 10-15 minutes. We ate the cold dinner, moist from condensate around 6:15. They did nothing to make amends for or even acknowledge this poor level of service...unless you count the glass of water. I don't think that covers it."

It's not too noisy and the ambient is perfect. There is not too much I can say, but in my opinion it's the environment is perfect. 2) Food: They have a solid menu. Their menu ranges from tacos, burritos to enchiladas and fajitas. Their chicken fajitas are one of the best I've ever had. 3) Service: The service here is excellent, the staff made sure that everything was okay with our food. The staff is extremely friendly and the service is also very quick.4) Other: They serve tortilla chips and salsa as soon as you arrive and I think that's just brilliant.In conclusion, this is one of my top restaurants.

Do you think of Taylor Swift and 2 Chainz at full-volume as being the perfect musical accompaniment to a meal? If so, then I have a spot for you...this El Vaquero location. However, as someone that likes to be able to have a conversation at dinner without having to shout to be heard and doesn't enjoy having the manager dismiss my feedback with nothing more than a simple, ""I'm sorry,"" I'm giving this location 1-star. (If you look at my other reviews, you'll see that I don't grant such low ratings frequently.) I don't go into any El Vaquero looking for fine dining, but I'm sure not expecting a strip club experience sans strippers...I'll try to keep this brief, as I could rant about how unpleasant this experience was to the point of exhaustion. I was seated in an area near a large table of people, and I instantly wondered why it sounded more like a club than a restaurant. I quickly came to realize that some genius had decided to put a Touchtunes jukebox in a restaurant, a jukebox that teenage boys in the large party were taking advantage of. Now, I'm not hating on their musical tastes, but it was the volume of the music that disturbed me. When the typical background music that plays in a typical El Vaquero is playing, it's acceptable. However, when this jukebox was playing, the speaker volume was pretty much maxed out. My friend and I honestly had to practically shout to talk. Simply unacceptable, and the genius who thought that it would be a good idea to have a blaring jukebox in a restaurant should be fired.So, I asked to be moved, and our server - who was great and seemed mortified by the music - apologetically indicated that there were no seats available in the other wing of the restaurant. I powered through my meal, determined to get out of there as soon as possible. When it came time for the checks, the server indicated that the cashier was also the manager, and that I should really let her know how I felt about my experience. I did so, as politely yet firmly as possible, and at first, she tried to shift the blame by indicating that I should have asked to be moved (which I did). After that, it was a matter of her handing me my receipt while saying, ""I'm sorry,"" about as dismissively as possible. I walked away with the impression that this particular manager was lacking in hospitality service skills.So, that's about it. The food was decent, the server was great, but between the loud music and the attitude of management towards customer concerns, this place delivered the worst dining experience I've had in a couple years. It takes a truly bad experience to cause me to post a negative review, because - as my other reviews show - even when my experience is somewhat disappointing, I still look for the positive and am generous - perhaps too generous at times - with my ratings. Consider yourself forewarned about Club El Vaquero.However, if you aren't put out by bad management and the potential to be all about the bass during your meal, the food is a solid 3-stars (and once again, our server was great). All said, I'd go elsewhere."

We had to ask for our chips twice and they didn't come out until our meal did. We had to ask for our check and it took him 15 minutes to get it to us. Poor planning on the managements part. Also, they had a special Cinco de Mayo menu that was either more expensive than their normal menu, or they have raised their prices a lot in the last year or so.

It's one of the best Mexican restaurants in Columbus according to many. They think it's the best Mexican they ever had. It is better than lots of others around. The reason is most of them go to Taco Bell and compare it to that so yes it's better. I ordered a margarita and the vegetable fajitas. It has a happy hour from 4 to 8. They have tequila shots for $2 and margarita pitchers for $16. It also has many daily specials. The margaritas are popular here. It's a wonder though because mine tasted watered down and there was not that much alcohol. The chips and salsa were pretty good, though. The vegetable fajitas had excellent taste, but there were problems with it. It only came with three small tortillas, not enough. They tried to charge me for asking for more. It also seemed overpriced for a bunch of toppings and vegetables. It was almost $13 which was ridiculous. That sucks and it wasn't even that good to begin with. At least they had free chips and salsa. You can eat lots of this to help make up for the cost. I would look for other Mexican restaurants before trying El Vaquero. It's kind of expensive for the quality and it's simply not that good to charge that much. Would return to order beer and cocktails because that's the reason why you go there."

The food at El Vaquero didn't even come close to what I've enjoyed south of the border.Fast forward to today and hubby persuaded me to give it another try. The service was friendly and quick. Then there was the food. I ordered the chicken flauta which was interesting. First of all I couldn't figure out how to eat them. They came at the bottom of a pile a of lettuce and feta cheese (very odd choice and taste for ""authentic "" Mexican cuisine) and were drizzled with a thin sour cream. You couldn't see the flauta for the salad. I couldn't just pick them up...too sloppy. When I dug them out and tried to slice into them, the fork wouldn't pierce them and the knife wouldn't cut them. I finally managed to carve off a slice and bit.  The flauta was hard as a rock...over cooked just short of being burnt. The chicken was totally dry. Horrible.  The accompanying rice was bland. My husbands dinner was, as he called it...a disaster. He couldn't cut into his Chile Rellenos and his Tostada was soggy.Columbus has many excellent Mexican restaurants.  This is not one of them!   Save your money and go elsewhere."

I had to yell at my friend just so she could hear me.Anyway, service is fast because they seem to be about getting people in and out as fast as they can.They gave us freshly fried chips that were really great! There was so much in the basket that I had to take it home. It lasted a few days! Salsa was pretty decent too! I ordered enchiladas. It was the kind that came with one beef, one chicken, one bean, and one cheese enchilada with a side of lettuce. Wow! Very good for the price! Enchiladas were a recommendation from my Mexican friend who said this is one of the few dishes they do well. I liked it, although I know I would've thought differently had I ordered something else.My friend also got enchiladas but hers were filled with cheese and had spinach on top. It's her go-to dish so she was of course pleased. She also had a huge margarita which she could barely finish.Overall, great place to go! They seem eternally busy every evening.

TONS of tried-and-true Mexican joints to choose from in the area, but we decided on this one. It's a big restaurant with lots of seating and a good atmosphere. Everything was going fine until we got our orders and on his first bite, my friend pulled a long hair out of his mouth. We understand things like this happen, it's not the end of the world. I would never include this in any public review if it weren't for the poor service we received in response. Naturally when this happens, you expect just a couple things: them to make another dish (which would be comped without hesitation), delivered with a sincere apology, usually from a manager who wants to make sure you're satisfied. Although our waiter did bring out a new dish, there was not one apology, not one attempt from a manager to personally make it right. On top of that, they billed us for the meal. We asked to speak to a manager, but were never approached. When we go up to pay our bill, the manager is the cashier.  We asked if anyone had told him we had an issue and wanted to speak with him, he said, ""yes but as you can see I'm kind of tied up right now."" My advice to upper management is (1) cross train your employees so that the manager on duty can do managerial tasks rather than stand at a register and avoid customer service issues, and (2) customer service training for this particular manager. I understand special cases, being short staffed is one. However, there had to be 3-5 employees literally just standing around the entire time we were eating. Not one of them can be trained to cash people out? Seems like a horrendous misuse of payroll. Long story short, had the manager made absolutely ANY attempt to make this right, this review would not exist. I will not be back."

Always have to manage expectations; right? As you can see, they're completely mixed.It took some time to get thru the menu; they offer a lot of options but most of it is just variations on the same thing thing.  Which is ok; they had shrimp, chicken, beef, pork and vegetarian options on most of the dishes. Then combos of them as well. On a funny note; for the chorizo nachos, you have to pay a couple bucks more for lettuce and tomato. Or, not so funny?I had the queso with shrimp.  Like other reviews had mentioned, the cheese sauce was a little thin.  But, the dish was filling; didn't need to order anything else. I thought cheese and shrimp might be good; I didn't prefer it.  Not a dig on them...found out that those 2 things together don't match well for me.And the rest of the story...Walking in the place was clean but smelled like cleanser. I went to the back bar which was almost completely dark.  Mood lighting for the 4:00 crowd I guess. A server was taking care of us; once the bartender came in she adjusted the lighting.  As she settled in for her shift, she was smelling the towels behind the bar before she used them. Odd, huh? There shouldn't be a question if the towels are clean. They have a giant tv behind the bar that wasn't on; I was almost out of there, no need to ask for it to be on. The guy next to me mentioned he was there for March madness and they only had one TV on; the bar area has a lot of tv's.Margaritas...skip em'. As another review mentioned, they're pre-made. He had asked the question, does it bother you?  For me, I guess it does. We have a restaurant at home that's the same size, always busy and they make each one as they're ordered.  A quick shake of the drink does make a difference. (they don't skimp on the tequila though)Lastly, the intercom system...no idea what was up with that. Was there a bingo tournament I wasn't aware of?Why am I giving this place 3 stars?  Because there were people there that the staff knew.  There was a group of repeat customers that came in after me that was getting together after work. They do have a customer base that appreciates what they do."

My friend and I came on a Wednesday in time for happy hour; they have great daily specials and the margaritas are seriously huge. A jumbo margarita for less than $8? I'm in. The intercom system they use to seat guests is very strange. I have never seen anything like that before. But hey, whatever works!  It was mainly families dining here; they have tons of seating and it started to fill up around peak dinner time. I agree with other reviewers that it can get noisy in this restaurant, but it's not too bad.The chips and salsa are not bad. We also ordered queso, which was also decent. It might be important to note that my friend and I are both from Texas, so we have slightly higher expectations for Tex Mex than some Midwesterners might have. The menu is HUGE. Tons of options. For dinner, I had enchiladas and my friend had a quesadilla. Both were huge portions with sides of rice and beans (a telltale sign of Tex Mex, in my opinion). The food was good, but didn't blow me away. You can tell it's a chain of restaurants. All in all, I think I would go back to try something else here, and if nothing else to enjoy another jumbo margarita at happy hour."

They all seem to vary in terms of quality when you dine at other El Vaqueros, but this one has always been a solid option for a quick Mexican meal! I went last Friday and it was extremely busy, but due to their size, were still able to sit us upon arrival. Our server was quick to help us and take orders and food came out quickly! Exactly what you'd expect out of a Mexican restaurant. She was great! My girlfriend had their chimichangas and I had the tacos al pastor, we split queso for our chips and each had a margarita. The food is 3-4 stars in terms of flavor, quality and presentation - nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either. The portions are large and will have you leaving full! I'm not sure if it was due to the busyness of the restaurant, but the presentation of our meals was pretty lack luster and unappetizing. One thing I will note with El Vaquero is that it can sneakily get expensive compared to other great Mexican/taco options in town. It was $60 total for the food and drinks mentioned above, which seems outrageous for a local chain Mexican spot. However, when you leave feeling full, it's tough to really complain about the price. Just be careful as it adds up quickly!"

In fact, I ordered two, that is how happy I was with my first drink.I've been going to El Vaquero so long that I feel like their menu changes all the time.  I'm certain that is not true, but they did recently go through another menu change.  The biggest addition from what I could tell was an entire page dedicated to street tacos, which if you ask me are all the rage right now.  I of course ordered three, and when I was there it wasn't very busy so they let me pick three different tacos to try.  I really enjoyed the tacos de tinga.  They went phenomenally with my house margarita on the rocks.  On this particular visit everything just hit the spot.  And our server was top notch.  I didn't even have to request a refill of water, he was so on top of it.If you are craving some solid Mexican food with delicious house made salsa, stop by El Vaquero."

They were playing Mexican music which I can listen to once in awhile. You have a choice of either patio or indoor dining. The menu is extensive. Complimentary chips and salsa are set on the table before you order. Quite frankly I could have eaten only the chips and salsa with a few margaritas instead of ordering a main entree. I eventually ordered a Fajita dish and she had a burrito dish. Each was about $9 and inline with other Mexican restaurants I have been to. The portion size was adequate for both of us.

The only thing, and I should have expected this, was that the burrito was starting to go mushy after being in the steaming hot bag for so long. Anything fried will do that, I need to start remembering this. Anyhoo, I loved that their queso had a little spice to it and I ate every drop they gave me. I really enjoyed the rice and despite the texture of the chimichanga, I still ate most of it. It was stuffed with peppers and zucchini and other veggies. While I loved the variety, I do wish they cut the veggies down to more bite size pieces. At one point I pulled out a piece of pepper that just kept going and going.

I ordered Cochinita Pibil and my husband got carnitas. His carnitas were juicy and flavorful. It came with flour tortillas, rice, beans, guac, sour cream pico and lettuce. He loved it. I got the Pibil which is slow roasted pork in achiote, lots of spices and citrus flavors wrapped in banana leaves served over rice with beans and same condiments as my husband. This is a bold flavor profile and was good. It's not on a lot of menus. I would have liked a little more citrus as the flavors were a tad muddled. Just needed perked up a bit. Let's talk rice and beans the true test of a Mexican restaurant. The beans were delicious. The right consistency, not runny, actual beans in it. It didn't taste like a can. Yum. The rice was light and fluffy. It's a yellow chicken rice vs red spanish rice. It was still good.We finished with the churros and coffee. It was delicious. Right amount of crispy and chewy drenched in cinnamon and sugar. These were filled with something, no idea what, just ate it, it was good.After a long day my strawberry margarita also hit the spot as did our yummy dinner."

It was not good! This is probably one of the few places I did not finish eating all of my food.Ordered: Bean Dip, 3 enchiladas w/ rice & beans, & Mojito Pros: the side rice and beans were decent. No salt was added and the beans were thicker than the bean dip.Cons: The bean dip was soupy and bland. The Mojito was very very limey, and the chicken in the enchiladas was dry & bland. The enchiladas also didnt have enchilada sauce. The chips that was served had no salt and were cold. You can tell they were not fresh at all. The server had a mask on, however, it was below his nose and mouth every-time he came to serve us."

It gets pretty busy, but the staff handles it well. There's a nice outdoor patio for summer days, and plenty of indoor seating. The chips usually come out warm, and they will refill your chips and salsa as much as you want.  I recommend ordering some cheese dip for those chips. The cheese dip here is so good! The menu here is pretty big. I've never had anything off the menu that I didn't like, but my go-to's when I'm here are the pozole soup, chimichangas, or the burrito jalisco (it's on their lunch menu but you can still order at dinner time for +$2).The drinks will give you a nice buzz. I like to get a margarita or a big Dos Equis to wash it all down."

The restaurant itself is pretty big with tons of indoor and outdoor seating. I went over lunch with some co-workers and there was a decent crowd. We picked our own table and were brought out some chips and salsa, per usual. The menu has a ton of options, but everything was notably pricier than similar style restaurants. They do have a few ""lunch specials"" which are regular menu items, just $1-2 cheaper than the usual price. Unfortunately, there are only 5 options to choose from in that section. Normally, I like to try a dish of chicken, queso and rice and really enjoy the typical melted queso poured on top. But they didn't have it, so I got the Pollo Marinado lunch special, which sounded similar. It is basically grilled chicken with shredded cheese on top, served with rice, beans and tortillas on the side. Honestly, I wasn't very impressed with my dish as it was something I could have easily made at home. Nothing necessarily bad about it, but nothing special either and I doubt I would get it again. When we got our checks, the waiter charged me for the regular entree instead of the lunch special, which was annoying, but they did fix it once I pointed it out. Overall, 2 stars for average food and higher prices than other similar restaurants."

The patio itself is spacious, nicely decorated, and doesn't feel like you're right off of Olentangy. I ordered a jalapeño margarita and a burrito Jalisco with angus steak. The jalapeño margarita tasted like an original margarita with slices of jalapeño peppers in it. I'm used to it either having jalapeño juice or muddled jalapeño in a margarita, so I wasn't getting much jalapeño flavor from it. The steak in the burrito was chewy and a bit dry. The burrito didn't come with the sides that were mentioned on the menu. Not sure why. The food did arrive quickly to the table, however. Overall, it was a disappointing experience and there's much better Mexican food elsewhere in the city."

I expected my confirmation email to contain instructions re: what to do when you arrive to pickup your food, but no such luck. So I arrive to the parking lot @ 12:45 exactly and I see several empty parking spots, all with individual signs indicating ""El Vaquero parking only"". I was had looked for curbside pickup specific signs and didn't see any. I called the restaurant's number from my email, and said who I was and that I was there to pickup food. The person asked which space I was in, and I told him I the color and make of car. He told me I should have parked in a numbered spot. I looked much further down and saw the designated parking area. Where I had parked was close to the entrance, so it made sense to me. He promptly brought my food out. I left for home, and was there within 5 minutes. To have prescheduled a pickup time, arrived promptly, and gotten home quickly we expected the food to be hot. The food was cold, as if it had been prepared when first ordered and then had sat there. There was no sauce for the enchilada, salsa was runny as water, and a side order of black beans was missing.  It wasn't worth it to call the restaurant back. We won't be partaking of their food again anytime soon."

Yes, the food was pretty good, the promptness of service was great, the staff were friendly and accommodating and the prices were pretty reasonable but sadly the ambiance was a total deal breaker in the bar area. There was a bucket and two mops standing outside the double door entrance to the kitchen and they were in plain sight of the patrons sitting at the bar many of them dining. When I am dining at a nice restaurant I would expect it to have a nice experience but those mops and that bucket in plain sight had killed it.
